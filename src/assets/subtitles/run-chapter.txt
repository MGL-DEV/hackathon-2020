This mission doesnâ€™t seem like a lust journey. We have some critical malfunction again thanks to your previous action. It seems the wheel of the Lucky Wheel ship has just stopped, the engines as well. I would not call this luck. You have to restart the engines by making the wheel spin manually. How can you do that? You should run around in the wheel like a squirrel!
TASK: LITERALLY RUN AT LEAST 15KM/H TO MAKE THE WHEEL SPIN AGAIN AND RESTART THE ENGINES! YOU HAVE HALF A MINUTE FOR THAT! GO FOREST GO GO!
